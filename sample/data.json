Young people are the army,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), a co-author of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Green New Deal resolution</a>, told them. “You put a spotlight on this issue in a way there has never been before.” </p>\n<p id=\"ZNh52X\">But Greta Thunberg, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/17/20864740/greta-thunberg-youth-climate-strike-fridays-future\">the most famous activist of them all</a>, wasn’t having any of it.</p>\n<p id=\"umDzVm\">“Please save your praise, we don’t want it,” said Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swede who has become the most recognizable<strong> </strong>and influential face of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/9/10/20847401/sunrise-movement-climate-change-activist-millennials-global-warming\">youth climate movement</a>. “Don’t invite us here to tell us how inspiring we are without doing anything about it. We don’t want to be invited to these kinds of meetings because, honestly, they don’t lead to anything.”</p>\n<p id=\"jsoRB2\">Thunberg, who has made a habit of reprimanding adults in power on their climate complacency, has learned that the frustration, impatience, and fear of young people for the catastrophic future is a powerful tool. And she used it on Democratic members of the Senate Climate Change Task Force.</p>\n<p id=\"Asb995\">At one point, Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE) told the assembled activists — which also included members of Fridays for Future, Zero Hour, and US <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/17/20864740/greta-thunberg-youth-climate-strike-fridays-future\">Youth Climate Strike</a> — they’d soon have the opportunity to seek office themselves, bringing more concrete change.

I know you’re trying, but just not hard enough.”</p>\n<p id=\"XSZtge\">Asked what their timetable was for passing climate legislation, the senators didn’t have many answers. Of course, as Markey told Thunberg and others, Democrats don’t have a lot of say right now because they don’t have a majority in the US Senate and don’t control the White House. And President Donald Trump is a climate denier who is trying to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. </p>\n<p id=\"eg7FtM\">The meeting ultimately revealed a riveting dynamic playing out right now in climate politics: With their hands tied by Republicans in power, the adults are looking to youth activists to create pressure.

The newspaper did not acknowledge anything of this sort. Instead, the Times story — based on a forthcoming book Pogrebin and Kelly are writing about the Kavanaugh allegations — was updated to say that friends of the student who may have been assaulted say she does not remember the alleged incident. </p>\n<aside id=\"gxVTCw\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The controversy surrounding the Times’s handling of the latest Kavanaugh allegation, explained\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/16/20868259/brett-kavanaugh-allegation-new-york-times-controversy-explained\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"ECaKw0\">Here’s the relevant passage of the Times piece, with the clause that was added in the second version in bold:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"OW3nfc\">We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier; <strong>the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"PvWB8H\">To be clear, the change is a significant one. If the student doesn’t recall the episode, the accusation that Kavanaugh and others may have assaulted her is arguably weaker than if she did. But, contrary to what Fox News would have you believe, the change to the Times story does not prove that the alleged incident didn’t happen. </p>\n<p id=\"Zreo2U\">As the above excerpt details, one of Kavanaugh’s classmates, Max Stier, claims to have witnessed the alleged misconduct, and told the FBI and US senators about his recollections. The allegation also tracks closely with a separate sexual misconduct allegation made by another Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s, Deborah Ramirez, who came forward during Kavanaugh’s SCOTUS confirmation process last year to accuse him of thrusting his exposed penis at her, prompting her to inadvertently touch it, during a drunken college party. </p>\n<p id=\"bTLbdN\">Furthermore, in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/reader-center/brett-kavanaugh-accusation-yale.html\">Q&amp;A piece</a> addressing criticisms of the Times’s presentation of the story, Times deputy editorial page director James Dao notes that Pogrebin and Kelly corroborated Stier’s allegation “with two government officials, who said they found it credible.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"b7rvVq\">A fixation on the Times’s process has helped obscure new information about existing allegations </h3>\n<p id=\"Q5kt5L\">Ramirez’s accusation was the second sexual misconduct allegation made against Kavanaugh last year. It came on the heels of an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford shortly after Kavanaugh’s nomination, accusing him of sexually assaulting her during a party when the two of them were high school acquaintances in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"8hZFqk\">In the New York Times article adapted from their forthcoming book, Pogrebin and Kelly write that months of reporting indicated to them that both Ford and Ramirez’s accusations are credible. From their piece:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"haB8KY\">But while we found Dr. Ford’s allegations credible during a 10-month investigation, Ms. Ramirez’s story could be more fully corroborated. During his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been “the talk of campus.” Our reporting suggests that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"7pCgiN\">At least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez’s mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge. Two of those people were classmates who learned of it just days after the party occurred, suggesting that it was discussed among students at the time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"pRRpFQ\">The significance of this part of the Times piece has been obscured by controversy surrounding the Times’s revision — one Pogrebin attributed during an MSNBC appearance to “the haste of the editing process,” with Kelly adding that their book “has a much fuller context.” Fox News, however, has already twisted the story into an opportunity to attack the New York Times in particular, and media outlets that try to hold Trump accountable in general.</p>\n<p id=\"zWrzhI\">On Tuesday morning, for instance, Fox News host Sandra Smith’s interviewed Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), largely about the Kavanaugh story. But instead of engaging with the substance of any of the allegations, Smith and Tillis teamed up to trash the New York Times, with Tillis dismissing the story as “another liberal media mob hit” and Smith falsely characterizing the piece as “corrected” and “botched.” This has been the vogue talking point both during the day and on Fox News’s primetime shows — to cite another example, on Monday night, host Sean Hannity accused the Times of “intentionally and willfully” misleading its readers, despite the fact that the Times has not retracted its reporting about the new allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"WNmHvy\">It should be noted that Fox News is <a href=\"https://thehill.com/media/461697-new-york-times-authors-on-kavanaugh-report-there-was-zero-intent-to-mislead\">not alone among media outlets</a> in conflating “correction” with clarification. And certainly the New York Times bears responsibility for not being careful to provide the full context for the allegation from the start. But the network is the most prominent voice among using the “editors’ note” to cast doubt upon all the allegations Kavanaugh faces — a tactic that has been taken up by the president himself. Fox News’s handling of the situation illustrates how willing the network is to seize on any opportunity to defend not only the president, but those aligned with him — even if its anchors must distort the facts to do so.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"QkNmkY\">\n<p id=\"WKCyLE\"><em>The news moves fast.

If the student doesn’t recall the episode, the accusation that Kavanaugh and others may have assaulted her is arguably weaker than if she did. But, contrary to what Fox News would have you believe, the change to the Times story does not prove that the alleged incident didn’t happen. \nAs the above excerpt details, one of Kavanaugh’s classmates, Max Stier, claims to have witnessed the alleged misconduct, and told the FBI and US senators about his recollections. The allegation also tracks closely with a separate sexual misconduct allegation made by another Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s, Deborah Ramirez, who came forward during Kavanaugh’s SCOTUS confirmation process last year to accuse him of thrusting his exposed penis at her, prompting her to inadvertently touch it, during a drunken college party. \nFurthermore, in a Q&A piece addressing criticisms of the Times’s presentation of the story, Times deputy editorial page director James Dao notes that Pogrebin and Kelly corroborated Stier’s allegation “with two government officials, who said they found it credible.”\nA fixation on the Times’s process has helped obscure new information about existing allegations \nRamirez’s accusation was the second sexual misconduct allegation made against Kavanaugh last year. It came on the heels of an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford shortly after Kavanaugh’s nomination, accusing him of sexually assaulting her during a party when the two of them were high school acquaintances in Maryland.\nIn the New York Times article adapted from their forthcoming book, Pogrebin and Kelly write that months of reporting indicated to them that both Ford and Ramirez’s accusations are credible. From their piece:\n\nBut while we found Dr. Ford’s allegations credible during a 10-month investigation, Ms. Ramirez’s story could be more fully corroborated. During his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been “the talk of campus.” Our reporting suggests that it was.\nAt least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez’s mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge. Two of those people were classmates who learned of it just days after the party occurred, suggesting that it was discussed among students at the time.\n\nThe significance of this part of the Times piece has been obscured by controversy surrounding the Times’s revision — one Pogrebin attributed during an MSNBC appearance to “the haste of the editing process,” with Kelly adding that their book “has a much fuller context.” Fox News, however, has already twisted the story into an opportunity to attack the New York Times in particular, and media outlets that try to hold Trump accountable in general.\nOn Tuesday morning, for instance, Fox News host Sandra Smith’s interviewed Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), largely about the Kavanaugh story. But instead of engaging with the substance of any of the allegations, Smith and Tillis teamed up to trash the New York Times, with Tillis dismissing the story as “another liberal media mob hit” and Smith falsely characterizing the piece as “corrected” and “botched.” This has been the vogue talking point both during the day and on Fox News’s primetime shows — to cite another example, on Monday night, host Sean Hannity accused the Times of “intentionally and willfully” misleading its readers, despite the fact that the Times has not retracted its reporting about the new allegation.\nIt should be noted that Fox News is not alone among media outlets in conflating “correction” with clarification. And certainly the New York Times bears responsibility for not being careful to provide the full context for the allegation from the start. But the network is the most prominent voice among using the “editors’ note” to cast doubt upon all the allegations Kavanaugh faces — a tactic that has been taken up by the president himself. Fox News’s handling of the situation illustrates how willing the network is to seize on any opportunity to defend not only the president, but those aligned with him — even if its anchors must distort the facts to do so.\n\nThe news moves fast.

A second worldwide strike is planned for September 27. </p>\n<p id=\"wFoJV7\">“If you can’t be in the strike, then, of course, you don’t have to,” 16-year-old Swedish climate activist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg\">Greta Thunberg</a>, the original school striker who last year began demanding more action from her government on climate change with weekly protests, told <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/greta-thunberg-climate-strike-teen-vogue-special-issue-cover\">Teen Vogue</a>. “But I think if there is one day you should join, this is the day.”</p>\n<p id=\"r2OJ64\">Thunberg has become an increasingly influential figurehead and voice for youth climate angst and activism.

Thousands of young people in the movement, called <a href=\"https://www.fridaysforfuture.org/\">Fridays for Future</a>, now strike every Friday to demand more aggressive action from their governments and the international community.

Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) takes part in a panel discussion led by Aimee Allison, touching the changes of the face of power in the United States after a history-making number of diverse members were sworn into Congress. | Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images</small>\n\n  <p>It’s the first step to getting an impeachment inquiry underway. </p> <p id=\"uZ6uWa\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/15/20866930/kamala-harris-julian-castro-brett-kavanaugh-impeachment\">Amid politicians’ calls</a> for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment, Rep. Ayanna Pressley is actually trying to get the process started.</p>\n<p id=\"Fj4YTP\">Pressley on Tuesday filed an impeachment resolution that presses the House Judiciary Committee to kick off an investigation that would mark the first step in an impeachment process. </p>\n<p id=\"MCi9Su\">The resolution urges the House panel to look into sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, and grants the committee subpoena power and resources as part of its investigation. Specifically, the resolution would enable the committee, or a task force it establishes, to conduct a probe into Kavanaugh, subpoena witnesses, and receive funding for this effort. The full House would have to approve the resolution for it to go into effect. </p>\n<p id=\"YATvo6\">“I believe Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors,” <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/09/16/pressley-kavanaugh-impeachment-effort\">Pressley said in a statement to WBUR</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"wLanFm\">Her push follows <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/9/16/20868338/brett-kavanaugh-new-york-times-impeachment-allegations\">a recent New York Times report</a> that detailed a new sexual misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh, who has declined to comment on it. Kavanaugh has also previously denied sexual misconduct allegations brought by Ford and Ramirez. </p>\n<p id=\"jQ2FnN\">Though the Democratic-controlled House could begin an investigation of its own, as Pressley is urging, impeachment of President Donald Trump’s second Supreme Court justice is pretty much a moot point, given the current make-up of the Senate. </p>\n<p id=\"aRh862\"><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/27/17910524/supreme-court-impeach-impeachment-brett-kavanaugh\">As Vox’s Dylan Matthews writes,</a> impeachment of a Supreme Court justice works pretty much the same way it would for a president:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"ISm26Y\">Impeachment and removal of a federal judge, including a Supreme Court justice, requires meeting a high political bar. Just as with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/12/15615066/impeachment-trump-process-history\">presidents</a>, a majority of the House must approve an indictment to impeach, and a two-thirds supermajority of the US Senate must convict for the judge or justice to lose their office.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"bmcQPz\">Although the chances of impeachment taking place remain very slim, Pressley’s resolution helps send a message about where Democrats stand on Kavanaugh. While Republicans have sought to dismiss the recent allegation that’s been levied against him and undercut the New York Times report, several Democrats have urged further review of the sitting justice. </p>\n<h3 id=\"l8EVux\">Some top Democrats have pushed for Kavanaugh’s impeachment </h3>\n<p id=\"RblK7l\">Several Democratic presidential candidates, including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/26/18679408/kamala-harris-2020-presidential-campaign-policies\">Sens.

Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) takes part in a panel discussion led by Aimee Allison, touching the changes of the face of power in the United States after a history-making number of diverse members were sworn into Congress. | Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\n  It’s the first step to getting an impeachment inquiry underway.  Amid politicians’ calls for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment, Rep. Ayanna Pressley is actually trying to get the process started.\nPressley on Tuesday filed an impeachment resolution that presses the House Judiciary Committee to kick off an investigation that would mark the first step in an impeachment process. \nThe resolution urges the House panel to look into sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, and grants the committee subpoena power and resources as part of its investigation. Specifically, the resolution would enable the committee, or a task force it establishes, to conduct a probe into Kavanaugh, subpoena witnesses, and receive funding for this effort. The full House would have to approve the resolution for it to go into effect. \n“I believe Christine Blasey Ford. I believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors,” Pressley said in a statement to WBUR.\nHer push follows a recent New York Times report that detailed a new sexual misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh, who has declined to comment on it. Kavanaugh has also previously denied sexual misconduct allegations brought by Ford and Ramirez. \nThough the Democratic-controlled House could begin an investigation of its own, as Pressley is urging, impeachment of President Donald Trump’s second Supreme Court justice is pretty much a moot point, given the current make-up of the Senate. \nAs Vox’s Dylan Matthews writes, impeachment of a Supreme Court justice works pretty much the same way it would for a president:\nImpeachment and removal of a federal judge, including a Supreme Court justice, requires meeting a high political bar. Just as with presidents, a majority of the House must approve an indictment to impeach, and a two-thirds supermajority of the US Senate must convict for the judge or justice to lose their office.\nAlthough the chances of impeachment taking place remain very slim, Pressley’s resolution helps send a message about where Democrats stand on Kavanaugh. While Republicans have sought to dismiss the recent allegation that’s been levied against him and undercut the New York Times report, several Democrats have urged further review of the sitting justice. \nSome top Democrats have pushed for Kavanaugh’s impeachment \nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro, are among those who have pressed for Kavanaugh’s impeachment in the wake of the Times report. \n“I said it last year and I’ll say it again: the process that resulted in the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh was a sham,” Harris said in a recent tweet. \nWhile the viability of idea has been dismissed by other members of Democratic leadership including Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (“Get real,” he recently told Politico), advocacy groups including Demand Justice and Planned Parenthood are among those who have urged further investigation. \nHarris on Tuesday sent House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler a letter on this very subject, suggesting that he should convene a task force to investigate Kavanaugh further. \nPressley’s latest action, at the very least, keeps the door open on this possibility.",

It’s a ploy that is in equal parts a self-serving voter recruitment push, an eye-catching pilot for his signature universal basic income proposal, and a campaign finance law minefield.</p>\n<p id=\"VL9Mtl\">“It’s time to trust ourselves more than politicians,” Yang said. “My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now.” </p>\n<p id=\"auLpnd\">He went on to tell all viewers who “believe you can solve your problems better than any politician” to visit his website to sign up for a chance to receive the money.</p>\n<p id=\"EQpEB7\">According to his campaign, that call has already been answered by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/16/andrew-yang-campaign-debate-lottery-1497649\">more than 450,000 people</a> and could attract far more; entries close on September 19. And those who enter won’t have long to wait to find out whether they will soon have $1,000 more a month to work with; the campaign says the 10 recipients will be notified by November 30. </p>\n<p id=\"GfUAqh\">Yang’s campaign centers on his proposal for a universal basic income, which the candidate refers to as a “freedom dividend.” As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/25/18758542/andrew-yang-universal-basic-income-twitter-contest\">Vox’s Sigal Samuel</a> explained, it would work like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"7iPpQd\">Yang says that if he becomes president, the government will send a check for $1,000 per month ($12,000 annually) to every American adult above the age of 18. (Whether Congress cooperates is another matter.) Again, no strings attached: You don’t get less money if you score a high-paying job, for example. And if you’re already getting housing assistance or food stamps, you can choose between keeping your current setup and switching over to Yang’s UBI program.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"gDtGvb\">The new pilot would work the same way but on a more limited scale. As a campaign aide told Vox ahead of the debate, Yang sees his version of UBI as being about “everything but the money.” The candidate argues that it is actually a tool Americans can use to combat growing automation and help spur homeownership, empower budding entrepreneurs, and reduce stress caused by financial insecurity. </p>\n<p id=\"DnwCn1\">Recipients of the money will be able to use it for anything they like, and Yang hopes the newly announced pilot will serve as a proof of concept that will both sway the idea’s detractors and shift his party toward supporting the idea in full, similar to how <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/26/18692909/bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-campaign-policies\">Sen. Bernie Sanders’s</a> advocacy for Medicare-for-all during the 2016 election season made that proposal a mainstream platform among Democrats.</p>\n<p id=\"sYedoR\">Before it does, however, it’ll bring huge swaths of new voters into his campaign’s orbit, and possibly some extra scrutiny from the federal government.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Z33SGw\">Campaign finance experts have raised concerns the new pilot breaks FEC rules </h3>\n<p id=\"MNnj72\">Yang has already begun testing his version of UBI on a small scale, giving $1,000 a month of his own money to families in early voting states <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/andrew-yang-to-give-iowa-family-1000-a-month-as-universal-basic-income-demonstration/\">Iowa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nhpr.org/post/nh-family-receive-1000-month-presidential-candidate-running-universal-basic-income#stream/0\">New Hampshire</a>. In June, he announced the winner of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/25/18758542/andrew-yang-universal-basic-income-twitter-contest\">Twitter contest</a> would be joining those families.</p>\n<p id=\"b1zJLd\">Those early experiments with UBI did not raise any red flags with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) or other experts both because he funded them with his own money and made it very, very clear recipients could and should vote for whomever they’d like. </p>\n<p id=\"qzGqQU\">But the expansion of the pilot program will work a bit differently: Yang’s campaign will be making the new payouts directly. That fact raised concerns the candidate was breaking federal election rules. Yang’s campaign has argued it has done nothing wrong, given it’s made clear recipients of the money are not expected or required to vote for Yang — essentially, that they are not buying votes. The campaign has also stressed that recipients don’t have to do anything at all, which former FEC commissioner Ann Ravel claims is exactly the problem. </p>\n<p id=\"dbujsB\">“If it’s just given for no work done, for nothing at all, just a gift, that is inappropriate,” Ravel told <a href=\"https://time.com/5675823/andrew-yang-freedom-dividend-election-law/\">Time</a>. “You can’t just give cash.”</p>\n<p id=\"eIodyC\">Erin Chlopak, director of campaign finance strategy for the Campaign Legal Center and former acting associate counsel at the FEC, agreed, telling Vox the pilot “seems like an illegal prohibited personal use” of campaign funds. </p>\n<p id=\"cyP27S\"><a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/making-disbursements/personal-use/\">FEC rules</a> state “using campaign funds for personal use is prohibited.” Personal use is defined as any expenditure a candidate would have even if they were not running for office — think things like family groceries, gym memberships, or mortgage payments. </p>\n<p id=\"OuWxTt\">Yang’s press secretary told Time that experts who believe the pilot breaks personal use rules are mistaken, because although Yang is obviously personally a believer in UBI, he is not a big enough believer that he would give away $120,000 of his own money as a private citizen. They argue he is disbursing the money only because he is running for president. </p>\n<p id=\"Ca68hf\">The campaign has some support from experts in this view. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rickhasen/status/1172298578284306433?s=20\">Rick Hasen, a UC Irvine professor of law and political science</a>, for instance, tweeted that as long as no restrictions are placed on who can get the money, the pilot ought to count as a creative form of campaign advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"Zujspi\">But Chlopak disagrees. She told Vox that while it may be true that UBI is central to Yang’s campaign, the pilot can’t count as advertising because there is no requirement that recipients contribute to Yang’s candidacy. To get the money, they do not have to tweet or post or in any way advertise for Yang. They don’t have to tell anyone they are receiving the money at all (although the random drawing’s rules do state recipients must allow the campaign to use recipients’ images royalty-free in promotional materials). </p>\n<p id=\"dqEkhk\">“If they were providing some sort of advertising service, perhaps it would be different,” Chlopak said, but recipients are not.</p>\n<p id=\"XUqgXp\">Yang himself is very confident he is on firm legal ground. He told <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1909/15/sotu.01.html\">CNN</a> his campaign has “an army of lawyers who have signed off on it. And we’re sure that this is perfectly legal.”</p>\n<p id=\"y3K4Lk\">Ordinarily, there would be a very easy way to find out who is correct: Ask the FEC. </p>\n<p id=\"epkUtC\">But these are not ordinary times. </p>\n<h3 id=\"l4TwdJ\">America’s elections watchdog is hamstrung</h3>\n<p id=\"mMB3s8\">Yang and his critics can’t settle the matter immediately with the FEC because, as the <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/federal-politics/federal-election-commission-fec-to-effectively-shut-down/\">Center for Public Integrity</a> has pointed out, the FEC technically does not exist at the moment. </p>\n<p id=\"VX867D\">The agency’s rules state that no meetings can be conducted without at least four commissioners present. FEC Vice Chairman Matthew Petersen resigned in August, leaving the agency with just three commissioners. The agency was last fully staffed with six commissioners in 2017. The three commissioners remaining have all completed their terms (Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub’s term expired in 2007), but are serving until they can be replaced. </p>\n<p id=\"QNKMik\">President Donald Trump has nominated one candidate, a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/440542-election-agency-limps-into-2020-cycle\">lawyer from Texas named Trey Trainor</a>, but despite being put forward two years ago, Trainor has not had the Senate hearing necessary for confirmation. Senate Republicans reportedly want to use the vacancies to appoint commissioners they favor (although no more than three commissioners affiliated with a given political party can serve at one time and there is already one sitting Republican, Caroline Hunter) and have put forward <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/federal-politics/fec-federal-election-commission-trump-mcconnell-schumer/\">lawyer Shana Broussard</a>, aide to current independent commissioner Steven Walther, as a top choice. But the Trump administration has yet to respond to this suggestion. </p>\n<p id=\"JPuP8w\">Chairwoman Weintraub has said the group that remains will continue to work as best it can and that it will work to create a queue that can be speedily addressed once a fourth commissioner is confirmed. But without a quorum, the agency can’t issue any rulings, including any decisions on whether Andrew Yang is following the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"cttVhF\">According to Chlopak, those concerned Yang has broken FEC rules have little recourse. She says in a case like this, the judiciary would likely be involved only after someone had filed a complaint to the FEC that went ignored. That person could then sue the FEC for failing to act on their complaint. But even should a court find in favor of the plaintiff, the FEC would just be ordered to make a decision on the complaint. </p>\n<p id=\"pAonSI\">Even if the FEC were to suddenly begin functioning as normal, however, there could be little clarity on the question of the pilot; even before the agency shut down, decisions were rarely rendered speedily. Now that it has a backlog, a final decision on a complaint filed about the pilot could come after the election was finished. And since by that time the money would have already been distributed, even if the FEC found Yang to be in the wrong it would be too late to really do anything about it. </p>\n<p id=\"cwGTA4\">Therefore, while questions about the legality of the pilot remain, there’s nothing to stop it from going forward. While it may not exactly be the paid advertising his campaign claims, the announcement of the program alone has indeed won Yang a great deal of publicity through press, and it will certainly energize the Yang Gang to further spread the universal basic income gospel online. </p>\n<h3 id=\"XRwgZr\">Yang’s $120,000 investment could pay huge dividends</h3>\n<p id=\"bGCHGV\">Beyond energizing his base and gaining fresh publicity, Yang’s campaign says his pilot has already paid for itself: It credits the announcement with helping to raise <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/16/andrew-yang-campaign-debate-lottery-1497649\">$1 million in the days following the debate</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"bDPd57\">Perhaps even more valuable than that immediate influx of cash, however,<strong> </strong>is the data Yang has been able to collect. To enter the drawing, one has to submit an email address and zip code. In the four days following the debate, the campaign says it has collected some 450,000 email addresses, 405,000 of which it says it didn’t already have.</p>\n<p id=\"iwaCTs\">According to <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/campaigns/campaigns-want-email-get\">Roll Call</a>, a candidate looking to access that many new emails from a database could expect to pay at least $180,000 (and as much as $1.3 million).

    "contentSnippet": "Andrew Yang following the second Democratic presidential debate in July 2019. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\n  Yang’s UBI pilot might violate campaign finance law, but there’s no one to stop it from going forward. Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang promised to spice up September’s primary debate by doing “something no presidential candidate has ever done before in history” live on television. \nHe kept that promise by announcing in his opening statement that he would give away $1,000 a month — $120,000 a year — to 10 randomly selected people as part of a pilot program for his universal basic income proposal. It’s a ploy that is in equal parts a self-serving voter recruitment push, an eye-catching pilot for his signature universal basic income proposal, and a campaign finance law minefield.\n“It’s time to trust ourselves more than politicians,” Yang said. “My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now.” \nHe went on to tell all viewers who “believe you can solve your problems better than any politician” to visit his website to sign up for a chance to receive the money.\nAccording to his campaign, that call has already been answered by more than 450,000 people and could attract far more; entries close on September 19. And those who enter won’t have long to wait to find out whether they will soon have $1,000 more a month to work with; the campaign says the 10 recipients will be notified by November 30. \nYang’s campaign centers on his proposal for a universal basic income, which the candidate refers to as a “freedom dividend.” As Vox’s Sigal Samuel explained, it would work like this:\nYang says that if he becomes president, the government will send a check for $1,000 per month ($12,000 annually) to every American adult above the age of 18. (Whether Congress cooperates is another matter.) Again, no strings attached: You don’t get less money if you score a high-paying job, for example. And if you’re already getting housing assistance or food stamps, you can choose between keeping your current setup and switching over to Yang’s UBI program.\nThe new pilot would work the same way but on a more limited scale. As a campaign aide told Vox ahead of the debate, Yang sees his version of UBI as being about “everything but the money.” The candidate argues that it is actually a tool Americans can use to combat growing automation and help spur homeownership, empower budding entrepreneurs, and reduce stress caused by financial insecurity. \nRecipients of the money will be able to use it for anything they like, and Yang hopes the newly announced pilot will serve as a proof of concept that will both sway the idea’s detractors and shift his party toward supporting the idea in full, similar to how Sen. Bernie Sanders’s advocacy for Medicare-for-all during the 2016 election season made that proposal a mainstream platform among Democrats.\nBefore it does, however, it’ll bring huge swaths of new voters into his campaign’s orbit, and possibly some extra scrutiny from the federal government.\nCampaign finance experts have raised concerns the new pilot breaks FEC rules \nYang has already begun testing his version of UBI on a small scale, giving $1,000 a month of his own money to families in early voting states Iowa and New Hampshire. In June, he announced the winner of a Twitter contest would be joining those families.\nThose early experiments with UBI did not raise any red flags with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) or other experts both because he funded them with his own money and made it very, very clear recipients could and should vote for whomever they’d like. \nBut the expansion of the pilot program will work a bit differently: Yang’s campaign will be making the new payouts directly. That fact raised concerns the candidate was breaking federal election rules. Yang’s campaign has argued it has done nothing wrong, given it’s made clear recipients of the money are not expected or required to vote for Yang — essentially, that they are not buying votes. The campaign has also stressed that recipients don’t have to do anything at all, which former FEC commissioner Ann Ravel claims is exactly the problem. \n“If it’s just given for no work done, for nothing at all, just a gift, that is inappropriate,” Ravel told Time. “You can’t just give cash.”\nErin Chlopak, director of campaign finance strategy for the Campaign Legal Center and former acting associate counsel at the FEC, agreed, telling Vox the pilot “seems like an illegal prohibited personal use” of campaign funds. \nFEC rules state “using campaign funds for personal use is prohibited.” Personal use is defined as any expenditure a candidate would have even if they were not running for office — think things like family groceries, gym memberships, or mortgage payments. \nYang’s press secretary told Time that experts who believe the pilot breaks personal use rules are mistaken, because although Yang is obviously personally a believer in UBI, he is not a big enough believer that he would give away $120,000 of his own money as a private citizen. They argue he is disbursing the money only because he is running for president. \nThe campaign has some support from experts in this view. Rick Hasen, a UC Irvine professor of law and political science, for instance, tweeted that as long as no restrictions are placed on who can get the money, the pilot ought to count as a creative form of campaign advertising.\nBut Chlopak disagrees. She told Vox that while it may be true that UBI is central to Yang’s campaign, the pilot can’t count as advertising because there is no requirement that recipients contribute to Yang’s candidacy. To get the money, they do not have to tweet or post or in any way advertise for Yang. They don’t have to tell anyone they are receiving the money at all (although the random drawing’s rules do state recipients must allow the campaign to use recipients’ images royalty-free in promotional materials). \n“If they were providing some sort of advertising service, perhaps it would be different,” Chlopak said, but recipients are not.\nYang himself is very confident he is on firm legal ground. He told CNN his campaign has “an army of lawyers who have signed off on it. And we’re sure that this is perfectly legal.”\nOrdinarily, there would be a very easy way to find out who is correct: Ask the FEC. \nBut these are not ordinary times. \nAmerica’s elections watchdog is hamstrung\nYang and his critics can’t settle the matter immediately with the FEC because, as the Center for Public Integrity has pointed out, the FEC technically does not exist at the moment. \nThe agency’s rules state that no meetings can be conducted without at least four commissioners present. FEC Vice Chairman Matthew Petersen resigned in August, leaving the agency with just three commissioners. The agency was last fully staffed with six commissioners in 2017. The three commissioners remaining have all completed their terms (Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub’s term expired in 2007), but are serving until they can be replaced. \nPresident Donald Trump has nominated one candidate, a lawyer from Texas named Trey Trainor, but despite being put forward two years ago, Trainor has not had the Senate hearing necessary for confirmation. Senate Republicans reportedly want to use the vacancies to appoint commissioners they favor (although no more than three commissioners affiliated with a given political party can serve at one time and there is already one sitting Republican, Caroline Hunter) and have put forward lawyer Shana Broussard, aide to current independent commissioner Steven Walther, as a top choice. But the Trump administration has yet to respond to this suggestion. \nChairwoman Weintraub has said the group that remains will continue to work as best it can and that it will work to create a queue that can be speedily addressed once a fourth commissioner is confirmed. But without a quorum, the agency can’t issue any rulings, including any decisions on whether Andrew Yang is following the rules.\nAccording to Chlopak, those concerned Yang has broken FEC rules have little recourse. She says in a case like this, the judiciary would likely be involved only after someone had filed a complaint to the FEC that went ignored. That person could then sue the FEC for failing to act on their complaint. But even should a court find in favor of the plaintiff, the FEC would just be ordered to make a decision on the complaint. \nEven if the FEC were to suddenly begin functioning as normal, however, there could be little clarity on the question of the pilot; even before the agency shut down, decisions were rarely rendered speedily. Now that it has a backlog, a final decision on a complaint filed about the pilot could come after the election was finished. And since by that time the money would have already been distributed, even if the FEC found Yang to be in the wrong it would be too late to really do anything about it. \nTherefore, while questions about the legality of the pilot remain, there’s nothing to stop it from going forward. While it may not exactly be the paid advertising his campaign claims, the announcement of the program alone has indeed won Yang a great deal of publicity through press, and it will certainly energize the Yang Gang to further spread the universal basic income gospel online. \nYang’s $120,000 investment could pay huge dividends\nBeyond energizing his base and gaining fresh publicity, Yang’s campaign says his pilot has already paid for itself: It credits the announcement with helping to raise $1 million in the days following the debate.\nPerhaps even more valuable than that immediate influx of cash, however, is the data Yang has been able to collect. To enter the drawing, one has to submit an email address and zip code. In the four days following the debate, the campaign says it has collected some 450,000 email addresses, 405,000 of which it says it didn’t already have.\nAccording to Roll Call, a candidate looking to access that many new emails from a database could expect to pay at least $180,000 (and as much as $1.3 million). And those prices are just to rent a list of emails — for $60,000 less, Yang now owns not only those emails, but knows where their users live, allowing for geographically tailored email marketing and fundraising.\nThese email addresses are key because they are seen as a good way to fundraise and as a particularly good way to pick up smaller donations, something that is key to getting into the Democratic debates. To make it into the September debate, for instances, candidates needed to have 130,000 unique donors across at least 20 states. The same threshold exists for the October debate.\nFor those not willing to rent or buy emails, the traditional way to net new ones has been through digital advertising — specifically through buying Facebook ads.\n“Facebook ads are a really valuable source for building your email list, and the more emails you have on your list, the more money you’re going to raise online,” Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, told the New York Times. “There’s a direct through line to resources for the campaign.”\nPresident Trump has embraced this strategy, spending more than $12.5 million on Facebook ads. His Democratic rivals have as well, but large Facebook spends do not always translate into fundraising or campaign success. Democratic candidate Tom Steyer, for instance, spent more than $4.7 million on Facebook ads ahead of the September debate, and while that number just managed to win him 130,000 donations, it failed to get him on the debate stage.\nWith his $120,000 outlay, Yang has avoided this sort of massive advertising spend and now has the potential to reap more rewards. If even a quarter of his new email addresses were to each lead to a $1 donation, he’d just about break even, and should some of them return $5 or $10, he’d be well ahead.\nEven if the users behind the addresses give nothing, Yang’s name will now be a constant presence in their inboxes, raising his name recognition, keeping him in their minds ahead of primaries and caucuses. \nAll of this means that although Yang’s pilot was somewhat risky given FEC rules, it is ultimately a very smart play, especially given how hamstrung America’s elections watchdog is.

But for parents, finding that help can be an ordeal.</p>\n<p id=\"YTgafJ\">As it stands, the current system simply isn’t built to accommodate the number of young people who could benefit from mental health care. </p>\n<p id=\"03lCGJ\">It’s a tall order just to get people into treatment; stigma still keeps too many out. But even those who are willing face many barriers. For one, there’s <a href=\"https://health.usnews.com/health-care/patient-advice/articles/2018-05-25/whats-the-answer-to-the-shortage-of-mental-health-care-providers\">a growing shortage of mental</a> health care providers, and young patients, who can’t often drive themselves, may need to travel far to find one. Treatment can be costly, and time intensive. Typically, psychotherapy (meaning talk-based therapy) takes place over the course of months, and is not often covered by insurance. All of these barriers may be greater for people in minority groups, or in poverty. </p>\n<p id=\"U5wnAn\">Here’s what it all adds up to: Mental health care simply isn’t reaching the majority of young people who could benefit from it in the United States. It’s <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900543\">estimated</a> around 25 percent of people under age 18 have suffered with some form of psychological problem. And there’s been an increase in the number of teens with depression, anxiety, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/7/11/18759712/teen-suicide-depression-anxiety-how-to-help-resources\">and who are suicidal.</a> But only about <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21156268\">a third of them</a> receive any help at all. </p>\n<p id=\"4rjl2S\">That’s the problem Jessica Schleider is trying to solve. She runs the Lab for Scalable Mental Health at Stony Brook University in New York, trying to find interventions to help fill the gaps that are as brief as possible, and don’t need to be administrated by a clinician.</p>\n<p id=\"ZLh1P9\">Think of it like therapy, but much, much shorter.</p>\n<p id=\"3hbWyf\">Psychotherapy — a.k.a. talk-based therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy being the most prominent — usually takes place over the course of weeks and months, in hour-long sessions. Schleider’s interventions are radically different: They take about 30 minutes each, and are partially drawn from cognitive behavioral therapy. Three of them are now available, <a href=\"http://www.schleiderlab.org/yes.html\">for free, online</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"ip0LkR\">Young people can try them out, and help out in evaluating the program. Adults can try them too, she says, but their data won’t be counted. </p>\n<p id=\"A3Rp0v\">Schleider is just beginning to measure whether this approach is truly effective. But a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28921523\">pilot study in 2018</a> with 96 participants showed that one 30-minute session decreased symptoms of anxiety and depression in kids compared to kids in a control group. More follow-up is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"5Hs8va\">But Schleider’s research is especially timely, given the growing mental health trends in young people. And by targeting kids and teens, she’s seizing an opportunity to pass on skills to help them cope with distress for the rest of their lives. Bite-sized therapy sessions may turn out to be one key way to do that. </p>\n<p id=\"G9pMo4\">“I don’t think what we’re doing will replace anything already out there,” Schleider says. “But there needs to be other options.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"IWiozE\">Accessing mental health care is difficult now. It’s only going to get worse.</h3>\n<p id=\"f7XCht\">There’s a strong case for some urgency in the need for mental health care innovation, given the insufficient supply of providers, and the barriers to accessing them. </p>\n<p id=\"i6zklC\">Today, “based on the sheer numbers, you don’t have enough psychologists, social workers, counselors, other therapists, to actually physically address the need that is clearly out there,” John Ackerman, the suicide prevention coordinator at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, told me a few months ago. In the future, the shortage will likely be much greater.</p>\n<p id=\"aUKOOP\">By 2025, the US Department of Health and Human Services predicts, the number of school counselors across the country will actually drop by thousands. Meanwhile, the demand for them <a href=\"https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bhw/health-workforce-analysis/research/projections/behavioral-health2013-2025.pdf\">is only going to rise</a>. “There’s no reason to think that access issues are going to improve,” Anil Chacko, a professor of counseling psychology at NYU, says. Overall, the HHS finds, that there could be a 10,000-plus mental health clinician shortage by 2025. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"xZWzPG\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:3650345\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"gMgrJP\">But even those willing and able to get to treatment are often underserved. Many pediatric clinics have months-long waiting lists. Complicating matters: Not all mental health care providers <a href=\"https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/looking-for-evidence-that-therapy-works/\">use</a> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23692739\">evidence-based treatments</a> when it comes to psychotherapy. Others are perhaps overreliant on medication, and focus less on teaching kids skills to cope. </p>\n<h3 id=\"xKEsL1\">What therapy in 30 minutes looks like</h3>\n<p id=\"AFfjCz\">That’s where Schleider’s Lab for Scalable Mental Health comes in. She’s hoping to create evidence-backed therapies that can be used to fill in some gaps. Maybe kids can use them while they wait for appointments with one-on-one therapists. Perhaps, one day, she hopes a pediatrician could send a child who is exhibiting signs of depression home with one of the programs. Or, even better, maybe some of these programs could be useful in preventing distress in the first place. </p>\n<p id=\"HwWLKu\">One of the interventions <a href=\"http://www.schleiderlab.org/yes.html\">you can try out</a> targets depression by teaching kids that they can grow, and change who they are. They’re taught — via voiceovers from scientists and kids who’ve sought help themselves — that people don’t stay sad and lonely forever, and that their brains are capable of being rewired, to be happier, and live easier. All it takes, sometimes, is changing our behaviors, and our patterns of thinking. </p>\n<p id=\"H4YhR2\">“By learning new ways of thinking, each of us can grow into the type of person we want to be,” the program teaches. After the Atlantic wrote about <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/08/can-you-just-got-therapy-once/596359/\">her work</a> in August, Schleider says she got a flood of emails from parents asking about the program. So she and her colleagues put it online.</p>\n<p id=\"gErWuJ\">There’s another module targeting self-hatred, teaching kids to be kinder to themselves. And a third one containing lessons on managing mood. The therapies contained in these programs are “all little pieces of what you might get in a full treatment package,” she says. “But nobody’s ever bothered to test whether <em>every</em> aspect of those full treatment packages need to happen in order for someone to make a change.” (All these programs are currently being evaluated for their effectiveness.) </p>\n<h3 id=\"TFJt8j\">The case for short-term psychotherapy — for some cases</h3>\n<p id=\"Sjil5S\">The stark reality that there are more potential mental health patients than practitioners  leads some to wonder: Is the status quo — weeks of psychotherapy — working for the greatest number of people? </p>\n<p id=\"mh7Lds\">The standard care of therapy traces its roots back to Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis, where patients would spend countless hours on a couch working through their problems with a therapist. Cognitive behavior therapy was created, in part, to streamline the process, and focus on the thoughts and behaviors that specifically impair a person’s life. But even CBT can take a long time. </p>\n<p id=\"TIKK9Z\">“We’re beginning to question, whether or not we need to do standard psychotherapy, defined as one hour a week, for X numbers of weeks,” Thomas Ollendick, a psychology professor at Virginia Tech who has been researching interventions on youth for decades. He’s developed a protocol for <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-three-hour-fix-for-phobia-a-four-day-therapy-for-ocd/\">treating child phobias</a> — like being afraid of dogs, the dark, and other fears — in a concentrated three-hour session. His studies find that these brief, intense sessions for phobias and anxiety could be as effective as treatments <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28772195\">that are spread out over months. </a></p>\n<p id=\"sGt9dm\">The work, he says, borrows lessons from learning theory. “If I want to teach you something that you currently don’t know how to do, the most efficient way to do that is not once a week for 50 minutes — it’s to do it in a concentrated period of time,” he says. “All that we’ve really done is to take the principles that are seen in standard CBT and put them into a condensed intensive format.” (A similar approach has led to condensing the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder, which usually takes months of therapy to treat, into an <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/4-days-of-intensive-therapy-can-reverse-ocd-for-years/\">intense four-day regimen</a> that seems to be effective <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29774005\">for at least a year.</a>) </p>\n<p id=\"Ewq4NN\">Therapy, in a way, is a form of learning — new thoughts, new skills, a new way to look at life. Follow-up in some form, will still be helpful or necessary to make the lessons stick, Ollendick says. </p>\n<p id=\"bWLHW3\">This approach — concentrating therapies into potent small doses — probably won’t work for all problems, or all people. A 2016 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28117056\">meta review</a> Schleider co-authored found single session treatments on youth are most effective when it comes to anxiety and child conduct problems. They were not effective for treating substance use disorder. And, overall, their effectiveness for depression was not statistically significant (but there also weren’t very many studies looking at their effectiveness for depression).    </p>\n<p id=\"XRD0zN\">“I think it’s a great idea,” Chacko says, overall, about bite-sized therapy. But, “I think the evidence is not there yet in terms of how beneficial this will be.” It could be much more useful in combating anxiety and phobias than it is for depression. Perhaps, it’s better suited to preventing anxiety from morphing into something like depression. More research is needed on what works, when, and for whom.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"u4yn9y\">To address mental health care gaps, more people will need to see themselves in the business of mental health </h3>\n<p id=\"4vQoVN\">Another part of the solution for closing gaps might be in broadening notions of who can administer mental health care, or act as an entry point to therapy. “If you’re interacting with people, you are dealing with their mental health,” Chacko says. It doesn’t just have to be clinicians directing kids to care, or to programs like Schleider’s.</p>\n<p id=\"zcY5aH\">One solution is to provide greater <a href=\"https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/84_992_999/en/\">training and support for parents</a> in dealing with their kids mental wellbeing. Another would just be to train more teachers to look out for the signs of suicide and depression, and to refer kids to resources should they need them. This is called gatekeeper training, and there’s some data it’s associated with a reduction in suicide deaths <a href=\"http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.08.037#\">in the short term</a>, at least.</p>\n<p id=\"JRsgYj\">No solution is perfect. That’s why a bigger tapestry of mental health care options is needed. </p>\n<p id=\"wXy2ub\">Schleider’s work at the Lab for Scalable Mental Health continues; she needs to collect more data on the effectiveness of these programs. “Right now we have four or five different programs we’re evaluating,” she says. “We want to get an excellent grasp of what they do, and how they do it, and for whom they can be supportive and helpful before getting to the point of saying ‘everyone should now do this thing.’” </p>\n<p id=\"ZWUFM0\">She hasn’t found the silver bullet to vanquish the rise of mental health problems in kids. But she’s more aware than ever the status quo isn’t enough. “Too many kids have gone without care for too long, and that’s why I’m doing this,” she says. </p>\n\n",

She runs the Lab for Scalable Mental Health at Stony Brook University in New York, trying to find interventions to help fill the gaps that are as brief as possible, and don’t need to be administrated by a clinician.\nThink of it like therapy, but much, much shorter.\nPsychotherapy — a.k.a. talk-based therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy being the most prominent — usually takes place over the course of weeks and months, in hour-long sessions. Schleider’s interventions are radically different: They take about 30 minutes each, and are partially drawn from cognitive behavioral therapy. Three of them are now available, for free, online. \nYoung people can try them out, and help out in evaluating the program. Adults can try them too, she says, but their data won’t be counted. \nSchleider is just beginning to measure whether this approach is truly effective. But a pilot study in 2018 with 96 participants showed that one 30-minute session decreased symptoms of anxiety and depression in kids compared to kids in a control group. More follow-up is needed.\nBut Schleider’s research is especially timely, given the growing mental health trends in young people. And by targeting kids and teens, she’s seizing an opportunity to pass on skills to help them cope with distress for the rest of their lives. Bite-sized therapy sessions may turn out to be one key way to do that. \n“I don’t think what we’re doing will replace anything already out there,” Schleider says. “But there needs to be other options.”\nAccessing mental health care is difficult now. It’s only going to get worse.\nThere’s a strong case for some urgency in the need for mental health care innovation, given the insufficient supply of providers, and the barriers to accessing them. \nToday, “based on the sheer numbers, you don’t have enough psychologists, social workers, counselors, other therapists, to actually physically address the need that is clearly out there,” John Ackerman, the suicide prevention coordinator at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, told me a few months ago. In the future, the shortage will likely be much greater.\nBy 2025, the US Department of Health and Human Services predicts, the number of school counselors across the country will actually drop by thousands. Meanwhile, the demand for them is only going to rise. “There’s no reason to think that access issues are going to improve,” Anil Chacko, a professor of counseling psychology at NYU, says. Overall, the HHS finds, that there could be a 10,000-plus mental health clinician shortage by 2025. \n\nBut even those willing and able to get to treatment are often underserved. Many pediatric clinics have months-long waiting lists. Complicating matters: Not all mental health care providers use evidence-based treatments when it comes to psychotherapy. Others are perhaps overreliant on medication, and focus less on teaching kids skills to cope. \nWhat therapy in 30 minutes looks like\nThat’s where Schleider’s Lab for Scalable Mental Health comes in. She’s hoping to create evidence-backed therapies that can be used to fill in some gaps. Maybe kids can use them while they wait for appointments with one-on-one therapists. Perhaps, one day, she hopes a pediatrician could send a child who is exhibiting signs of depression home with one of the programs. Or, even better, maybe some of these programs could be useful in preventing distress in the first place. \nOne of the interventions you can try out targets depression by teaching kids that they can grow, and change who they are. They’re taught — via voiceovers from scientists and kids who’ve sought help themselves — that people don’t stay sad and lonely forever, and that their brains are capable of being rewired, to be happier, and live easier. All it takes, sometimes, is changing our behaviors, and our patterns of thinking. \n“By learning new ways of thinking, each of us can grow into the type of person we want to be,” the program teaches. After the Atlantic wrote about her work in August, Schleider says she got a flood of emails from parents asking about the program. So she and her colleagues put it online.\nThere’s another module targeting self-hatred, teaching kids to be kinder to themselves. And a third one containing lessons on managing mood. The therapies contained in these programs are “all little pieces of what you might get in a full treatment package,” she says. “But nobody’s ever bothered to test whether every aspect of those full treatment packages need to happen in order for someone to make a change.” (All these programs are currently being evaluated for their effectiveness.) \nThe case for short-term psychotherapy — for some cases\nThe stark reality that there are more potential mental health patients than practitioners  leads some to wonder: Is the status quo — weeks of psychotherapy — working for the greatest number of people? \nThe standard care of therapy traces its roots back to Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis, where patients would spend countless hours on a couch working through their problems with a therapist. Cognitive behavior therapy was created, in part, to streamline the process, and focus on the thoughts and behaviors that specifically impair a person’s life. But even CBT can take a long time. \n“We’re beginning to question, whether or not we need to do standard psychotherapy, defined as one hour a week, for X numbers of weeks,” Thomas Ollendick, a psychology professor at Virginia Tech who has been researching interventions on youth for decades. He’s developed a protocol for treating child phobias — like being afraid of dogs, the dark, and other fears — in a concentrated three-hour session. His studies find that these brief, intense sessions for phobias and anxiety could be as effective as treatments that are spread out over months. \nThe work, he says, borrows lessons from learning theory. “If I want to teach you something that you currently don’t know how to do, the most efficient way to do that is not once a week for 50 minutes — it’s to do it in a concentrated period of time,” he says. “All that we’ve really done is to take the principles that are seen in standard CBT and put them into a condensed intensive format.” (A similar approach has led to condensing the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder, which usually takes months of therapy to treat, into an intense four-day regimen that seems to be effective for at least a year.) \nTherapy, in a way, is a form of learning — new thoughts, new skills, a new way to look at life. Follow-up in some form, will still be helpful or necessary to make the lessons stick, Ollendick says. \nThis approach — concentrating therapies into potent small doses — probably won’t work for all problems, or all people. A 2016 meta review Schleider co-authored found single session treatments on youth are most effective when it comes to anxiety and child conduct problems. They were not effective for treating substance use disorder. And, overall, their effectiveness for depression was not statistically significant (but there also weren’t very many studies looking at their effectiveness for depression).    \n“I think it’s a great idea,” Chacko says, overall, about bite-sized therapy. But, “I think the evidence is not there yet in terms of how beneficial this will be.” It could be much more useful in combating anxiety and phobias than it is for depression. Perhaps, it’s better suited to preventing anxiety from morphing into something like depression. More research is needed on what works, when, and for whom.  \nTo address mental health care gaps, more people will need to see themselves in the business of mental health \nAnother part of the solution for closing gaps might be in broadening notions of who can administer mental health care, or act as an entry point to therapy. “If you’re interacting with people, you are dealing with their mental health,” Chacko says. It doesn’t just have to be clinicians directing kids to care, or to programs like Schleider’s.\nOne solution is to provide greater training and support for parents in dealing with their kids mental wellbeing. Another would just be to train more teachers to look out for the signs of suicide and depression, and to refer kids to resources should they need them. This is called gatekeeper training, and there’s some data it’s associated with a reduction in suicide deaths in the short term, at least.\nNo solution is perfect. That’s why a bigger tapestry of mental health care options is needed. \nSchleider’s work at the Lab for Scalable Mental Health continues; she needs to collect more data on the effectiveness of these programs. “Right now we have four or five different programs we’re evaluating,” she says. “We want to get an excellent grasp of what they do, and how they do it, and for whom they can be supportive and helpful before getting to the point of saying ‘everyone should now do this thing.’” \nShe hasn’t found the silver bullet to vanquish the rise of mental health problems in kids. But she’s more aware than ever the status quo isn’t enough. “Too many kids have gone without care for too long, and that’s why I’m doing this,” she says.",

This means that American oil production is fairly sensitive to global oil prices.

    "contentSnippet": "Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and US President Donald Trump with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Osaka Castle Park during the G20 Summit on June 28, 2019. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\n  “Saudi Arabia pays cash.” Saudi Arabia announced this weekend that attacks on two of its state-owned oil facilities — launched either by Iranian-backed Houthi forces in Yemen or by Iran itself, depending on whom you ask — had disrupted the country’s oil production. \nPresident Donald Trump’s response was unusual, even for him. Normally, Trump takes a crass, transactional view on foreign policy, rejecting the pro-forma assumptions about maintaining good diplomatic relationships with allies. Instead, he made a glaring exception to those rules on behalf of Saudi interests.\nFirst, the president argued that “we don’t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas.” Then he made an apparent vow to not only come to Saudi Arabia’s assistance anyway but also to completely defer to the Saudi royal family as to “under what terms we would proceed.”\n\n\nBecause we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you, Mr. President!), we are a net Energy Exporter, & now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don’t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia does not have a formal treaty of alliance with the United States — meaning there is no piece of paper obligating the US to do anything whatsoever in response to an attack against Saudi Arabia. And while the US has been intimately involved in the Saudi oil industry going back to the 1930s, nobody has ever claimed there is a deep connection grounded in values between our two countries. \nBut the Saudi royal family does seem to have a special relationship with Trump, who has repeatedly bucked bipartisan congressional majorities to back the Kingdom on topics ranging from its disastrous war in Yemen to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\nIt’s a fishy situation that naturally raises questions about Trump’s personal financial relationships with Persian Gulf monarchies — questions he and his allies in Congress have been successfully stonewalling for years. \nAnd his official explanation of the need for a cozy relationship with the Saudis — that they are a valuable customer for American arms merchants — makes very little sense, though it does cohere with his larger nonsensical views about international trade as a whole.\nAmerica makes a lot of oil now\nAfter sinking for almost 40 straight years starting in 1970, American production of crude oil and natural gas has skyrocketed for the past 10 years, thanks largely to technological improvements in fracking and horizontal drilling. \n  \n        \n      Energy Information Agency\n  \nAs a result of this, the United States is now the world’s largest producer of petroleum and natural gas. \n  \n        \n      Energy Information Industry\n  \nThis surge in American oil production means that changes in global energy prices impact the American economy in very different ways today than they did in the 1990s or 2000s. \nThis is particularly true because while the United States now produces a lot of oil, American oil is still relatively difficult to extract compared to Persian Gulf oil. This means that American oil production is fairly sensitive to global oil prices. In other words, when prices rise not only do US oil producers earn higher profits they also intensify the investment in extracting oil. \nSo for many players in the American economy, higher oil prices are now a good thing. Fracking communities experience localized economic booms, Alaska gets much higher government revenue, and a broader supply chain of American manufacturers of drilling-related equipment get more orders. \nWhen oil prices dropped precipitously in the winter of 2014-’15, many drivers celebrated cheap gas. But it also contributed to a localized mini-recession as business investment and manufacturing output fell. \nExpensive oil used to be a hammer blow to the American economy, and that isn’t quite true anymore. But it’s still the case that for most people the main economic impact of oil prices is on the price they pay at the pump, and that expensive gas is economically damaging. \nGas prices still matter economically \nAt the end of the day, most Americans do not work in the oil industry or live in a community that has a large oil extraction industry.

For a few moments, Bertolucci shows just this portrait – of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/freud\">Lucian Freud</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\">Francis Bacon</a> – then a sensual jazz score slowly starts, and the film’s opening credits roll alongside this unmoving canvas. It is succeeded by a brutally dissected female figure sitting on a wooden chair – another Bacon portrait, this time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jan/08/guardianobituaries2\">Henrietta Moraes</a>. Eventually, the two paintings are seen side by side. Then we cut to Marlon Brando in a camel overcoat on a Paris bridge, yelling: “Fucking God!”</p><p>Behind Bertolucci’s eerie use of these oil paintings is the shocking story of an art exhibition that gripped Paris, established Bacon as the great European artist he had always dreamt of being – and left a man dead in a hotel toilet. Bertolucci was so astounded by Bacon’s solo show at the Grand Palais – which opened in October 1971, just as he was preparing to make his film in the French capital – that he took Brando to see it. He urged the actor, he later recalled, to “compare himself with Bacon’s human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon’s face and body were characterised by a strange and infernal plasticity”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/17/francis-bacon-paris-death-toilet\">Continue reading...</a>",

For a few moments, Bertolucci shows just this portrait – of Lucian Freud by Francis Bacon – then a sensual jazz score slowly starts, and the film’s opening credits roll alongside this unmoving canvas. It is succeeded by a brutally dissected female figure sitting on a wooden chair – another Bacon portrait, this time of Henrietta Moraes. Eventually, the two paintings are seen side by side. Then we cut to Marlon Brando in a camel overcoat on a Paris bridge, yelling: “Fucking God!”Behind Bertolucci’s eerie use of these oil paintings is the shocking story of an art exhibition that gripped Paris, established Bacon as the great European artist he had always dreamt of being – and left a man dead in a hotel toilet. Bertolucci was so astounded by Bacon’s solo show at the Grand Palais – which opened in October 1971, just as he was preparing to make his film in the French capital – that he took Brando to see it. He urged the actor, he later recalled, to “compare himself with Bacon’s human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon’s face and body were characterised by a strange and infernal plasticity”.

And there is little evidence that this billion-dollar industry is cleaning up its act. </p><p>By Tess McClure</p><p>In February, crystals colonised Tucson. They spread out over carparks and gravel lots, motel courtyards and freeway footpaths, past strip malls and burger bars. Beneath tents and canopies, on block after block, rested every kind of stone imaginable: the opaque, soapy pastels of angeline; dark, mossy-toned epidote; tourmaline streaked with red and green. There were enormous, dining-table-sized pieces selling for tens of thousands of dollars, lumps of rose quartz for $100, crystal eggs for $1.50. Crystals were stacked upon crystals, filling plastic trays, carved into every possible shape: knives, penises, bathtubs, angels, birds of paradise.</p><p>It was the month of the Tucson gem shows, a series of markets and exhibitions that collectively make up the largest crystal expo in the world. More than 4,000 crystal, mineral and gemstone vendors had come to sell their wares. They were expecting more than 50,000 customers to pass through, from new age enthusiasts with thick dreadlocks and tie-dye T-shirts, to gallery owners, suited businessmen and major wholesalers. Deals done here would determine the fate of tens of thousands of tonnes of crystals, dispatching them across the US and Europe into museums and galleries, crystal healing and yoga centres, wellness retailers and Etsy stores.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/17/healing-crystals-wellness-mining-madagascar\">Continue reading...</a>",

We want every child to receive proper help – not simply be sent away and told to look at a self-help website – be that via existing services or via a new framework, including a new national childhood mental health service.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Peer-to-peer wellbeing support in all secondary schools</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every school should be encouraged and helped by government to start a peer-to-peer programme where children support one another, dispel stigma and help with greater understanding of mental ill health. This would help drive cultural change in schools and lead to more children getting the help they require.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Mental health training for all teachers embedded in university courses</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teachers must be equipped with the skills and knowledge to help tackle the mental health crisis. The Scottish Government has pledged to ensure that all councils offer “mental health first aid” training for staff by the end of the 2019-20 school year, but we think that they need to go further and embed mental ill health training in university courses, so it’s not seen as an afterthought. Additionally, all school staff –such as catering staff – should be trained to look out for signs of mental ill health among pupils.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Launching Mind the Future, the editor of The Scottish Sun, Alan Muir, said:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Scotland’s future is its children; yet we are failing them miserably.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Suicides among teenagers doubled last year amid a childhood mental health crisis that’s spiralling out of control.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Today – backed by leading charities – we launch our Mind the Future campaign.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We know there is no quick fix. But our push has three key demands to help stem the current crisis and build the foundations to enable the next generation to cope with life’s ups and downs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The statistics exposing this national scandal are damning. Experts say around one in nine children will have a mental health condition while growing up – yet just a quarter are getting the specialist help they need.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In the past year, more than 5,000 young people referred due to mental ill health were forced to wait over 18 weeks for treatment – including 288 forced to wait over a year. Thousands more who were sent into an under-resourced system as professionals decided they needed help were then turned away – mostly without a face-to-face assessment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So far, the Scottish Government has been making the right noises. But it has not yet translated into the action that’s needed. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our campaign and its aims are backed by leading charities – the Scottish Association for Mental Health, the Mental Health Foundation, and Samaritans Scotland.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The experts agree our three asks are far from pie in the sky – nor will they cost an arm and a leg. But they will require a culture shift – and a move away from the sticking-plaster approach of recent years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Only by reducing the number of troubled kids will we reduce the number of troubled grown-ups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Minds matter far more than society and those in power have so far recognised.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></p>\n<p></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s time for a wake-up call. To think of the future – not just the present. And to halt the shameful toll of suicides and mental illness which threatens to devastate a generation.”</span></p>\n",

We recruited subscribers. We turned a profit. And we continued to invest in the highest quality journalism. This might seem obvious now but it is only with hindsight that we see that we were years ahead of our rivals.</p>\n<p>[The industry is] still an exciting place to be. It always will be. The task is to adapt to the new technology, to make it our friend, to put it at the service of our journalism.”</p>\n",

The prize, worth £1,500, follows his efforts championing the brand during The Sun Savers education campaign to inform customers about the programme.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The education initiative saw News UK’s Field Team roll out a nationwide retail campaign across 12,000 news and magazine retailers in the UK to increase awareness of Sun Savers – the rewards club that puts money back into readers’ pockets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of the campaign News UK placed new point of sale assets in stores to demonstrate and clearly communicate the mechanics of the Sun Savers scheme to customers, with the campaign message: Earn Cash, Get Treats, Win Prizes. The initiative was designed to help retailers educate customers on the merits of Sun Savers and explain the role newspapers play in-store for retailers, driving footfall and increasing spend.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Giselle doorstepped Sam and his wife at their Post Office in Loughborough to give them the good news, coinciding with Sun Savers reaching one million sign ups.<br />\n<iframe src=\"//players.brightcove.net/5436121860001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6049987397001\" width=\"600\" height=\"339\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When presented with his prize, Sam told The Sun that he will take his wife of 30 years with him on holiday and said: “I’m feeling in cloud cuckoo land!”.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Commenting on the programme Sam said: “The Sun field team brings great material that helps to highlight the Sun Savers reward programme &#8211; it just keeps the customers coming back for more. The team has helped me to educate myself, which in turn I have educated my customers. It’s a win, win situation.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>News UK Head of Retail Marketing Chris Hughes said:</strong> “We know how hard retailers work so I’m delighted that we can reward Sam with a well deserved holiday! Sam won the award for clearly demonstrating his knowledge of the scheme and the benefits to customers. The judges were particularly impressed with the way Sam embraced the education programme by training all of his staff and displaying highly visible point of sale assets in-store to promote Sun Savers to customers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Sun Savers’ success is important both for us as a publisher and for retailers too &#8211; so we can keep loyal and engaged readers coming back into your store. Thanks to all our retailers that took part in this initiative and helping us on our journey to one million Sun Savers sign ups.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sun Savers editor Giselle Wainwright said:</strong> “It was a pleasure to meet Sam and thank him for all his hard work in promoting Sun Savers. We know that our readers spend on average £8 per week than other newspaper shoppers so by promoting the programme our loyal readers can become your loyal customers! Thanks to all the retailers that champion The Sun every day and help us to do what we do best!”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fifty runners up also each received £50 vouchers for their involvement with the initiative.</p>\n",
